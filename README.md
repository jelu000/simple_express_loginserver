# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with https://expressjs.com/. I use as a backend server for to test my React simple_react_cilent that also can be pulled from my github account.

This is made from this tutorial: 
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-add-login-authentication-to-react-applications

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `node server.js`

to start de server, and after that you can run the simple_react_client pulled from my github.
